<h1>tagsetbench</h1>

<p>At the heart of <code>tagsetbench</code>, there is a directory-based spooler
(<code>spooler.py</code>)
which peeks at files in a designated directory and runs the oldest file
(usually a script), optionally making it executable beforehand.</p>

<p>Scripts which automate the whole process of training, evaluating and comparing
of (modified) corpora, are created by <code>generate_measurements.py</code>,
which is to be edited manually.</p>

<p>The generated scripts first invoke <code>configure</code>, which creates
a directory with a full environment consisting of <code>Makefile</code>s, source
corpora (symlinked) and various components of <code>tagsetbench</code>.
<code>configure</code> prints the created directory name (disambiguated with
the current date and time) to standard output. The directory name is then
passed to <code>make</code>, the traditional UNIX build tool, which runs the
<code>Makefile</code>s. I suffered a lot generating them, a lot. Never more.
(Perhaps Meson and its ninja backend would have saved me from pain.)</p>

<p>The generator, not very conveniently for fresh setups, relies on a special type
or URIs to be supported. Just like <code>mailto:</code> or <code>irc:</code>
result in an action, I created <code>tagsetbench:</code>, <code>spooler:</code>
and <code>enqueue:</code> pseudo-protocols (the last one should be made a part
of <code>spooler:</code>.</p>

<p>The links are handled by <code title="perhaps to be called URI 4 Life">my-uri-handler.py</code>,
and are configured
in <code>~/.config/mimeapps.list</code>, to which lines such as <pre>
[Added Associations]
…
x-scheme-handler/geany=protocol-geany.desktop;
x-scheme-handler/okular=protocol-okular.desktop;
x-scheme-handler/dicto=protocol-dicto.desktop;
x-scheme-handler/enqueue=protocol-enqueue.desktop;
x-scheme-handler/tagsetbench=protocol-tagsetbench.desktop;
x-scheme-handler/notes=protocol-notes.desktop;
x-scheme-handler/spooler=protocol-spooler.desktop;</pre>
should be added.</p>

<p>The <code>*.desktop files</code> (found in this archive) should be copied/linked
to <code>~/.local/share/applications</code>. The <code>deploy.sh</code> script
shows how this can be done.</p>

<p>Back to the generator. Internally, it calls <code>xdg-open</code> to “run” the
<code>tagsetbench:</code> links just as if they were clicked in e.g. a web browser.</p>

<p>This causes <code>my-uri-handler.py</code> to be called with a link like
<code>tagsetbench:run?FILTER;MATCH;k=\?;lc=-;SET;tag=kIx~;COMPARE;id=annotate-dashes</code>
– there are quite a few examples in <a href="pokusy.html">the list of experiments</a>.</p>

<p>As a result, a script is generated and stored in a directory designated by
the <code>MEASUREMENTS_DIR</code> constant.</p>

Futher guidance will be given at <a href="https://github.com/lenoch">https://github.com/lenoch</a>
in two new projects: <code>tagsetbench</code> and <code title="or just life-hacks">uri4life</code>.
