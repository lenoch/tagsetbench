This package contains the RFTagger which is freely available for
academic research and education. The technical details of the RFTagger
are documentated in the COLING08 paper available in the doc directory.

Tagger Usage
============

On Linux systems, you can annotate data with the shell scripts in the
cmd directory. Here is an example:

> cmd/rftagger-german test/german.txt

These scripts also comprise a tokeniser which converts the input into
1-word-perl-line format.

On other systems than Linux, you have to compile the tagger first (see
below) and you have to tokenise the input yourself. The parameter files
will only work on Intel x86 or compatible processors.

Compilation and installation of the source code
===============================================

1. Move to the src directory
   > cd src
2. Compile the tagger
   > make
3. Leave the source directory and make a test
   > cd ..
   > src/rft-annotate lib/german.par test/tokgerman.txt
4. You can install the tagger in /usr/local/bin using the command
   > make install
   (Modify the PREFIX variable in the Makefile in order to choose
    a different installation directory.)
5. To install the man pages use the command
   > make maninstall

This package contains parameter files for German, Czech, Slovene, 
Hungarian and Russian. All parameter files use UTF8 encoding.

The German parameter file was trained on the Tiger2 treebank. 
(http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/korpora/tiger.html)

The Czech parameter file was trained on the Czech Academic Corpus 1.0
(http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/rest/CAC/cac_10.html).

The Hungarian parameter file was trained on the Szeged treebank 2.0
(http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/projectdirs/hlt/).

The Slovene parameter file was trained on the JOS corpus
(http://nl.ijs.si/jos/index-en.html). This corpus is described in the
following publication:
Toma. Erjavec, Darja Fi.er, Simon Krek, Nina Ledinek: The JOS
Linguistically Tagged Corpus of Slovene. Proceedings of the Seventh
International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation
(LREC'10), Malta, 2010.

The Slovak parameter file was trained on the Slovak National Corpus.
(http://korpus.juls.savba.sk/).

The Russian parameter file was trained on the corpus
i-ru-sample.txt.gz which was kindly provided by Serge Sharoff.


Tagger Training
===============

The tagger can be trained on new data using the program rft-train.
The minimal requirement for the tagger training is a manually annotated
training corpus and a wordclass automaton. You can use the automaton
stored in wordclass/wordclass.txt for this purpose or create your own
automaton as explained in wordnet/README. The file formats and the
available options are documented in the manpages of rft-train.

Tagset Design
-------------

The RFTagger treats the POS tags as ATTRIBUTE vectors rather than
atomic symbols. The period symbol is used as an attribute
separator. Thus, the POS tag ART.Indef.Nom.Sg.Masc is an article (ART)
with the attributes "Indef", "Nom", "Sg", and "Masc". The number of
attributes must be the same for all POS tags with the same initial
feature (= BASE CATEGORY such as ART in the example). Otherwise the
tagger will report an error. All attributes appearing at a certain
position after some base category (such as ART) implicitly form a
FEATURE whose possible values are the attributes.

Consider the following POS tags which include a problematic element:

ART.Indef.Nom.Sg.Masc
ART.Def.Acc.Sg.Masc
ART.Def.Dat.Pl.Fem
ART.Acc.Sg.Neut.Def

The possible values of the different features of wordclass ART are:

Feature 1: Indef, Def, Acc
Feature 2: Nom, Acc, Dat, Sg
Feature 3: Sg, Pl, Neut
Feature 4: Masc, Fem, Def

Conclusion: Make sure that the order of the attributes is correct
because the tagger is unable to detect mistakes other than a varying
number of attributes for a given base category.

Here is another example:

V.Inf
V.Part.Past
V.Fin.3.Sg.Pres.Ind

The tagger will not accept these tags because the number of attributes
of the base category V varies. Replace these tags with

VInf
VPart.Past
VFin.3.Sg.Pres.Ind

to avoid these problems.
